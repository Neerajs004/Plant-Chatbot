# Plant-Chatbot
Title: PlantDocBot : AI Plant Disease Diagnosis via Chat and Image Upload
Objective:
To develop an AI-powered chatbot that allows users (especially farmers and gardeners) to
upload images of plant leaves or describe symptoms via text, and receive accurate plant disease
diagnosis and treatment recommendations using image processing and natural language
processing techniques.
Outcomes:
• Gain hands-on experience with computer vision and NLP integration.
• Learn how to build and fine-tune image classification models for disease detection.
• Develop a conversational AI chatbot capable of interpreting symptoms via text.
• Deliver an interactive tool capable of diagnosing common plant diseases from photos or
messages in real time.
Dataset:
• PlantVillage Dataset (for image-based plant disease classification): Open-source dataset
from PlantVillage, covering over 50,000 annotated plant leaf images.
• PlantDoc Dataset (real-world noisy images): Available on Kaggle.
• Text Corpus for Plant Symptoms: Collected from agricultural forums, blogs, and
research papers (open-access sources).
Modules to be Implemented:
1. Dataset Collection and Preprocessing
o Clean and augment image datasets, prepare NLP corpus.
2. Image-based Plant Disease Detection Module
o Train CNN models like ResNet or MobileNet on leaf images.
3. Symptom-based Text Diagnosis Chatbot
o NLP model using BERT or GPT-based architecture to understand and respond to
symptom descriptions.

4. Recommendation System for Treatment
o Link detected diseases to cure methods and preventive measures.
5. User Interface and Image Upload Mechanism
o Web or mobile frontend allowing chat-based interaction and image uploads.
6. Testing, Evaluation & Deployment
o Combine and test modules, evaluate performance, prepare documentation.
